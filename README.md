以下是正常的安装使用流程，但是删除了google-services所以下载后并没有数据，需要进一步信息可以联系我。

1. Preparatory Work
Make sure that the computer has Android Studio and the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. 
Use Android Studio as your development environment, program in Java, and utilize API 29 as the virtual machine version for development.

2. Importing the Project
Open up Android Studio.
Select "Open an Existing Android Studio Project."
Navigate to the project folder and select it.

3. Configuring the Environment
Ensure that the build.gradle (module-level) and build.gradle (project-level) files are matched accordingly.
Make sure the AndroidManifest.xml file is aligned.

4. Compilation and Deployment
Choose the "Build" menu, then select "Rebuild Project" to compile the project.
If the compilation is successful, you can choose the "Run" menu and then select "Run 'app'" to run the project on a simulator or connected device.
To deploy the application, select the "Build" menu, then choose "Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)" and follow the prompts to generate an APK file.
The generated APK file can be directly installed on an Android device.
